# USNVC Analyses
Repo for analyses using data on the US National Vegetation Classification system

Python code included in this repository is used to analyze protection status for various US National Vegetation Classification System (USNVC) land cover categories. It utilizes a raster version of the USGS Gap Analysis Project's Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) and the hierarchical land cover classification system of the USNVC.
