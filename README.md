# Assessing the Conservation Status of Vegetation using the U. S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC)
Repo for analyses using data on the US National Vegetation Classification system

Python code included in this repository (https://github.com/mjrubino/USNVC-Analyses[SEA1] [MA2] ) is used to analyze protection status for various US National Vegetation Classification System (USNVC) land cover categories. It utilizes a rasterized version of the USGS Gap Analysis Project (GAP) Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) v2.1 (USGS GAP, 2020; https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT) and the hierarchical land cover classification system of the USNVC.
